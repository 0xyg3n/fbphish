* ## Description
> Facebook Phishing for educational Purposes ONLY.
> This Phising will come handy for social-engineering techniques.
> The reason i created this repo is because facebook is using an algorithm to load all the page resources randomly.
> That means everytime you want to use facebook login page as a phising, it will only be available for a while because the code is dynamically loaded, which also means that > every image and css code is loaded dynamically and randomly.
> I just collected all the images and the css code and i made them static so this code will always working.

* ## Undetected
> The way i coded it with php allows me to use the phishing template and the facebook cannot even detect it so when you access the profile you hooked it will not log you out and  ask you to verify your identity because it did not detect that the profile has been phished.
