## About
Facebook Phishing for educational Purposes ONLY.
This is a version of greek Facebook mobile version.
This Phising will come handy for social-engineering techniques.
The reason i created this repo is because facebook is using an algorithm to load all the page resources randomly.
That means everytime you want to use facebook login page, it will only be available for a while because the code is dynamically loaded,  
which also means that every image and css code is loaded dynamically and randomly.
I just collected all the images and the css code and i made them static to the code so it doesn't also require to send any requests to facebook.com.
